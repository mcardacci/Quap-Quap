### Purpose
Quap is an acronym for Question, User, Answer, Picture. It's an app built in Sinatra that helps itâ€™s user to learn Cantonese. It utilizes a Home Brew text to speech app, alongside a Question, Answer, and Picture for an easy mnemonic device. Modeled after Duo Lingo.

The Sinatra Skeleton:

1. Provides a foundation for building challenges or creating a new Sinatra application.
2. Demonstrates a reasonable set of practices around building Sinatra applications.
3. Eases the transition to Rails for Dev Bootcamp students
